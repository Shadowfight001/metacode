## Introduction

This project implements a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows the creation (minting) and destruction (burning) of tokens and keeps track of each address's balance.

## Features

- Public variables for token details (name, abbreviation, total supply).
- Mapping to store the balance of each address.
- Mint function to create new tokens.
- Burn function to destroy tokens, with checks to prevent burning more tokens than the address holds.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shadowfight001/metacode.git
   cd ymetacode
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies if any.

## Usage

To use this project, you can deploy it on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain using a tool like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. Below are the instructions for using Remix.

### Using Remix

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file and paste the contract code into the file.
3. Compile the contract.
4. Deploy the contract using the "Deploy" button in the Remix interface.
5. Interact with the contract using the deployed instance.

### Example Usage

```solidity
// Minting 100 tokens to the address 0x123...
MyToken.mint("0x123...", 100);

// Burning 50 tokens from the address 0x123...
MyToken.burn("0x123...", 50);
```

## Functions

### Public Variables

- `myTokenName`: The name of the token (e.g., "Udit").
- `myTokenAbbr`: The abbreviation of the token (e.g., "Udi").
- `totalSupply`: The total supply of the token.

### mint(address _address, uint _value)

Creates new tokens and assigns them to the specified address. Increases the total supply by the specified value.

**Parameters:**
- `_address`: The address to which the tokens will be minted.
- `_value`: The number of tokens to mint.

### burn(address _address, uint _value)

Destroys tokens from the specified address. Decreases the total supply by the specified value. Ensures the address has sufficient balance to burn the tokens.

**Parameters:**
- `_address`: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
- `_value`: The number of tokens to burn.

**Requirements:**
- The address must have a balance greater than or equal to the number of tokens to burn.
